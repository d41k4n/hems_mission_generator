St.Gallen Kantonsspital 1.1
by Henry Favretto (aka Daikan)

Based on the original work by Pascal KÃ¼ffer for FS9, modified for X-Plane 10 with kind permission.

NOTES:
======
This scenery has been created and tested using:

- ZL16/17 orthophoto for +47+009 with HD mesh: http://simheaven.com/?page_id=8
- World2XPlane 0.5 beta: simheaven.com/experimental/

The heliport's ICAO code is "KSSG" (unofficial).

Some buildings might be slightly floating above ground (limitation by the FS2XPlane conversion).


INSTALLATION:
=============
1. Unzip the directory "Custom Scenery" into your X-Plane home
2. Adjust scenery load order as needed. See:
