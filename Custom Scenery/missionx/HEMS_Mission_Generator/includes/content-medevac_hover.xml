Hiking accident: In this mission you will have to fly an HEMS mission to a location on your GPS to assist with a winch-extraction of an injured person followed by safe transfer to designated hospital.

Details on the accident location and accident type will be provided at mission start. Usage of a helicopter is mandatory.

Hints for winch extraction:

- Crew will operate doors and winch boom autonomously when within target range.
- Lower, raise or stop winch when instructed.
- Observe status messages during all operations and follow instructions.
- Maintain a stable hover to prevent inducing dangerous oscillations while the winch is extended.
- Once patient and crew recovery is complete you will be instructed to proceed to the next waypoint.

Hints for patient dropoff:
- Land on the helipad designated via GPS.
- Shut down engines
- Observe status messages and follow instructions.
- Wait for signal to take off.
