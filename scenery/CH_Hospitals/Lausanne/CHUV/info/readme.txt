Based on the original work by Pascal KÃ¼ffer for FS9, modified for X-Plane 10 with kind permission.

RECOMMENDED ADDONS:
===================

- OSM Europe: http://simheaven.com/?page_id=208&wpfb_file=1129

==================

Due to the relatively "dumb" conversion from FS9 there will be some floating objects depending on the base mesh in use.

INSTALLATION:

1. Unzip the directory "Custom Scenery" into your X-Plane home.
2. Adjust scenery load order as needed. See:
