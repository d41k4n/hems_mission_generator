Universitätsspital „Insel“ Bern
-------------------------------

Installation:
Unzip file Insel.zip in addon scenery folder of flight simulator and register the scenery in flight simulator in Settings/Scenery library. (eg. C:\Programs\Microsoft Gamees\Flight Simulator 9\Addon Scenery) Restart flight simulator - that’s it!! Define settings in Settings/View/Scenery complexity as no lower than Standard. 

General:
The scenery has been designed in Gmax and optimised for the mesh of Switzerland Professional. To save system performance, a series of different LODs have been created.  

To note:
As I have experienced in the past, the objects often cannot be positioned precisely enough in terms of height and orientation.
If you would like to adapt the scenery to your own mesh, you require the *.xml and *.mdl files contained in the zip file. The bgl compiler (bglcomp.exe and bglcomp.xsd) can be downloaded from: 
http://www.microsoft.com/games/flightsimulator/fs2004_downloads_sdk.asp#bgl
If you would like to adapt the refuge’s orientation, you have to make changes in length and width as required in the *.xml document. Sometimes you also need to adjust the height value (you can find the exact values when you press the Y key in flight simulator). When you adjusted the values, you drag & drop the *.xml file onto the bglcomp.exe file. This will generate a new *.bgl file, which will now replace the old bgl file in the scenery folder.
Important: In order for the compilation to work properly, the *.xml and *.mdl files must be in the same folder as the bglcomp.ex and bglcomp.xsd.
