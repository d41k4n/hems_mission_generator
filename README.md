# HEMS Mission Generator
A HEMS (**H**elicopter **E**mergency **M**edical **S**ervice) random mission generator for the [X-Plane](https://www.x-plane.com) flight simulator. 

### Content
The package basically includes the following:

 - config files (.xml, .ini, .txt)
 - scripts (.bas, .lua)
 - custom overlay scenery for hospitals
 - a custom heliport scenery library ([heliport_lib](https://github.com/d41k4n/hems_mission_generator/tree/master/scenery/heliport_lib))
 - custom aircraft definitions (.acf)
 - various resources (e.g. images)

### Limitations
In the current state it provides dedicated mission templates for HEMS missions originating out of a subset of heliports located in __Switzerland only__ as well as for a limited number of aircraft models. 

Currently supported origin heliports:
- LSMD DÃ¼bendorf ([Rega 1](https://www.rega.ch/en/our-missions/sites-and-infrastructure/rega-1-zurich-base) home base)
- LSXU Untervaz ([Rega 5](https://www.rega.ch/en/our-missions/sites-and-infrastructure/rega-5-untervaz-base) home base)
- LSZF Birrfeld ([Lions 1](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIONS_1) home base, operated by [Alpine Air Ambulance AG](https://www.air-ambulance.ch/))
- LSZE Zermatt (operated by [Air Zermatt](https://www.air-zermatt.ch/))
- LSGS Sion (operated by [Air-Glaciers](https://www.air-glaciers.ch/))

This might be extended and/or made more generic in the future.
